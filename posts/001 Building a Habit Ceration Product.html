        <h2 class="subtitle">How to Create Sticky Products Users Love</h2>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            First important term to understand, any company´s dream metric —
            Stickiness: the degree to which customers return to your product
            again and again. A sticky product strengthens the relationship with
            a customer over time, encouraging engagement with additional
            products and services through the customer lifecycle.
          </p>

          <p>How do we get here?</p>

          <p>
            If you look at the most habit formation products, you´ll notice that
            one of the things these goods and services do best is remove bits of
            friction from the user´s life. The central idea is to create an
            environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em">
            <li>
              Meal service delivery removes the friction of shopping for
              groceries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town.
            </li>
            <li>
              Texting reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate,
            or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of
            fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to
            create an account. They deliver the products with easy to understand
            directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Business is a never ending quest to deliver the same result in an
            easier fashion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Much of the battle of building better products comes down to finding
            ways to reduce the friction associated with good and productive
            habits and increase friction with bad ones. Redesign a product so
            that the solution that matters the most are also the actions that
            are easiest to do. 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day
            are done out of habit, capitalize on this.
          </p>

          <p>In short: Make a product the path of least resistance.</p>
