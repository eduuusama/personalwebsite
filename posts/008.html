          <p>
            When starting a new company, as innovators we look for something new
            and exciting. This can be inspired by other new technologies,
            discoveries, markets or trends, and could potentially fall into the
            trap of having a solution and later looking for a problem to solve
            with it. Here are some ways to prevent this:
          </p>

          <p>
            Describe the problem in 5 words or less. The fewer buzz words (which
            are usually just trendy) the better. Another great way of defining
            the problem is by filling in this phrase: We solve A for B by doing
            C. This has to be clear to all parties involved, founders, team,
            investors and clients. By this time you should have enough
            understanding of the space, the target audience and the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start with the smallest version possible. Really distill into what
            is the MVP and core function of your solution. To the bare bones.
            What about your product will be undeniably unique and will be the
            main cause for retention for customers. Hit the most important
            problem first and hard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Validate hypothesis. If the solution you came up with is actually
            solving an existing problem, there will be interest right away. This
            does not have to be a full software development, a landing page that
            receives interest could be enough. This can also save you time and
            effort before building a full MVP.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remain open to change. One of your greatest assets at this time of
            your journey is the adaptability and readiness to change course. Any
            action that limits this agility can swiftly undermine your chances
            of success. With a perfectionist mindset, you try to create elegant
            automated systems that operate in harmony, but this is not a worthy
            goal at this time. Focus on launching a viable product by any means
            necessary and getting it to your customers. The time for refining
            will come later, with a larger team and more resources.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's understandable for technologists and innovators to be
            enthusiastic about developing novel, cutting-edge solutions.
            However, it's vital to anchor these innovations in genuine,
            practical and real-world problems. Many fall in love with the
            solution and not the problem. While it's natural for engineers and
            innovators to be excited about building new, innovative products,
            it's crucial to ensure that these creations are grounded in
            real-world problems. And although it's really easy in theory, it's
            fucking hard. But hopefully by keeping these principles as a guiding
            pole, I can avoid falling into investing a bunch of time into
            something that is pretty cool but ultimately useless for people.
