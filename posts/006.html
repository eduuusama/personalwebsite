        <h2 class="subtitle">
          The emergence of AI has sparked a surge of startups across various
          sectors, but only those that can truly innovate and reimagine human
          experiences will succeed.
        </h2>
        <time datetime="2024-06-02">Jun 2, 2024</time>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            The emergence of ChatGPT by OpenAi was the last drop that unleashed
            a tsunami of AI startups through basically all sectors, industries
            and domains. This groundbreaking innovation is poised to reshape
            every sector, from healthcare to finance, and the ripple effects are
            already being felt. Amidst the hype, a countless number of tools,
            startups, and APIs that have emerged, each fighting for a slice of
            the AI pie (which is a massive one). Yet, the harsh reality is that
            only a select few will succeed. To stand out and thrive, an AI
            company must be built on three foundational pillars.
          </p>

          <h3>Reimagining the human experience with AI</h3>
          <p>
            To revolutionize industries, and win the race in their particular
            sector, startups must go beyond merely integrating AI into existing
            frameworks. The true disruptors will be those who completely
            reimagine and redesign the human experience with AI. This means not
            just enhancing but fundamentally transforming workflows. Incumbents
            like Google, Microsoft, SAP, and many more, with established
            distribution channels can afford to incrementally integrate AI into
            their systems, creating a formidable barrier for new entrants.
            Incumbents that have distribution can push out incremental AI
            innovation into their existing workflows, blocking the opportunity
            for startups.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key to overcoming this challenge lies in innovation.
            Re-inventing the user experience is essential in order to disrupt
            and wedge into these legacy situations. This means that for a
            startup to win, the focus needs to be on winning the distribution
            game and this can only happen by fully disrupting and fully
            re-imagining the existing workflows. Specifically, this means that
            instead of plugging AI into an existing UX (nobody likes the little
            bubble on the right of every screen), the startup must re-invent and
            make the entire UX better. A customers wont care about any
            particular technology unless it solves a problem in a superior way.
          </p>

          <h3>Creating a data well</h3>
          <p>
            "Data is the new oil" — has been said many, many times, and is
            specifically true now in the age of AI — ONLY if the data is:
            organized, accurate, relevant, safe, unique and consistent. If not
            we are back to square one, unless, we are creating data from a
            proprietary source and shaping it to feed an LLM correctly. Remember
            — big data is usually dumb.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the AI company is purely algorithmic, without proprietary data
            set, then it has no moat and its not defensive long term. The value
            proposition comes from proprietary data that then can be fed into a
            proprietary ML (technology) to create a competitive advantage.
          </p>

          <p>How does an AI company create proprietary data?</p>

          <p>
            One way is through creating a new and valuable business workflow
            which generates proprietary data as result of running a workflow.
            These are not exactly considered AI businesses, but I believe they
            have the best advantage.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example Company Y is the largest provider of fast casual photo
            and video services for e-commerce brands. Its core business involves
            virtual shoots, where brands send products to Company Y and receive
            high-quality photo and video assets. This process has generated
            millions of proprietary photos and videos. Now, Company Y has
            launched an AI offering that leverages this extensive dataset to
            accelerate and reduce the cost of creating branded assets.
            Proprietary data in, true value proposition out.
          </p>

          <h3>Bonus: The Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its
            closest existing substitute. This is extremely difficult and
            anything else is simply incremental improvement. Design improvements
            are hard to measure, but can make a 10x difference. (Apples
            proprietary tech is not 10x better than Lenovo, HP, Microsoft etc).
            Design = experience, which is extremely important.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technological breakthroughs often emerge from exploring uncharted
            territories. In the realm of AI, this means looking where others
            aren't. Whether it's developing faster microchips, creating more
            efficient code, or unlocking new insights into human behavior, the
            opportunities for innovation are boundless. The question every AI
            company must ask itself is whether it is creating a genuine
            technological breakthrough or merely an incremental improvement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Does your startup have or is looking to create a breakthrough in
            technology instead of a big improvement?
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, the future of AI is bright, but only those who can
            reimagine human interaction, harness the true power of data, and
            develop superior technology will lead the charge. As a leader poised
            to build an AI company, the focus must be on creating transformative
            experiences, leveraging proprietary data, and pushing the boundaries
            of what's possible with AI. By doing so, we can not only ride the
            wave of AI innovation but also shape its course, bringing
            unparalleled value to customers and redefining industries along the
            way.
