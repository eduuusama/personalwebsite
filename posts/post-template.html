          How AI Could Transform the World for the Better

            I think and talk a lot about the risks of powerful AI. The company
            I'm the CEO of, Anthropic, does a lot of research on how to reduce
            these risks. Because of this, people sometimes draw the conclusion
            that I'm a pessimist or "doomer" who thinks AI will be mostly bad or
            dangerous. I don't think that at all. In fact, one of my main
            reasons for focusing on risks is that they're the only thing
            standing between us and what I see as a fundamentally positive
            future.

              upside of AI could be</strong
            >, just as I think most people are underestimating how bad the risks
            could be.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this essay I try to sketch out what that upside might look
            likeâ€”what a world with powerful AI might look like if everything
            goes <em>right</em>. Of course no one can know the future with any
            certainty or precision, and the effects of powerful AI are likely to
            be even more unpredictable than past technological changes, so all
            of this is unavoidably going to consist of guesses. But I am aiming
            for at least educated and useful guesses, which capture the flavor
            of what will happen even if most details end up being wrong. I'm
            including lots of details mainly because I think a concrete vision
            does more to advance discussion than a highly hedged and abstract
            one.
