              This is a note to self, born of personal experiences, advice,
              books, knowledge, and the mosaic of life's events I've
              encountered. The order of these thoughts does not prioritize one
              over another unless expressly stated. This is just a personal
              guide through my personal and professional entreprenurship
              journey, that constantly changes and adds more knowledge.

            Have three to win, the fourth comes by itself.<br />
            Team . Idea . Timing . Money
          </p>

          <h3>The Founders</h3>
          <p>
            Brilliant thinking is uncommon, but courage is even rarer. Founders,
            the building block of a startup, are convinced they can change the
            future. Their focus should be on long-term goals, rather than
            rivals. Disruptors seek challenges but avoid unwinnable battles.
            Disruptors are people who look for trouble and find it, but don't
            pick a fight they cant win.
          </p>
          <p>
            Great companies have secrets: Specific reasons for success that
            other people don't see. Every great business is built around a
            secret that's hidden from the outside. Each founder must sell, the
            idea. This creates a mafia type culture, which is intoxicating. It
            will attract talent, investors, and provide personal fulfillment to
            anyone involved. Pass on any company that founders dress up for a
            pitch, interview or meeting. Avoid social entrepreneurs that aim to
            combine doing good and making money, they usually don't end up doing
            neither. Doing something different is what's actually good for
            society, creating a business with profits to keep doing things
            different, and naturally better. How well does the founders know
            each other? Have they worked together before?
          </p>

          <h3>The Team</h3>
          <p>
            The foundations â€” a startup messed up from its foundations cannot
            ever be fixed. Bad decisions made early on hardly ever correct
            themselves. If founders develop irreconcilable differences, the
            company becomes the victim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone in the company has to get along, can the founder give a
            friendly hug to everyone in the company? if not, can he trust him?
            Its impossible to build a company without a team. Pay the CEO the
            least possible to have a sense of urgency, pay him enough for a long
            term decision making. Either set a max as a precedent to the rest,
            or humble the team by being paid the least. Don't fight the perk
            war. The founder should convince talent as a personal calling rather
            than payment, equity or perks. At the beginning everyone except
            lawyers and accountants must be full time. Period. At the beginning
            everyone comes every day to a physical office. Period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its more powerful yet more risky for the founders to be distinctive
            individuals. They should attract both fame and infamy. Be more
            tolerable with unusual, weird, nerd founders as long as they bring
            out the best work from everyone else in the company. Are these the
            right founders?
          </p>

          <h3>The Idea</h3>
          <p>
            Assess if the idea is vertical (innovative) or horizontal (improving
            existing concepts). Bold ideas are preferable to trivial ones. The
            idea should not only create value but also capture it. It must be
            difficult to substitute. The most valuable companies of the future
            empower humans not substitute them. Big data is usually dumb.
            Computers are tools not rivals. Computers find patterns that elude
            humans. Making something new is far more important than making
            something better. Technology is supposed to increase mastery over
            nature and reduce the role of chance in our lives, as humans we seek
            comfort in predictability. Do not limit yourself to technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the idea ready for the unpredictable future? Think about every
            angle, and how can it be applied in the future. (Reddit, FB, is the
            fuel for AI before it existed.) What's the secret behind this idea?
          </p>

          <h3>The Technology</h3>
          <p>
            Proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its
            closest existing substitute. Anything else is simply incremental
            improvement. Design improvements are hard to measure, but can make a
            10x difference. (Apples proprietary tech is not 10x better than
            Lenovo, HP, Microsoft etc). Design = experience, which is extremely
            important.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two technical breakthrough approaches, technology of
            nature (a faster microchip or better code and secretes of people
            (human behavior, habits or approaches). The best place to look for
            technological breakthrough is where nobody else is looking. (AI
            wink, wink).
          </p>
          <p>
            Does this company create a breakthrough in technology instead of a
            big improvement?
          </p>

          <h3>The Business Plan</h3>
          <p>
            A bad plan is better than no plan. Sales matter just as much as
            product. In a business money is either important or everything. A
            business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the
            future. Projections are useless and a waste of time for both
            founders and investors. At least until Series A. Tech companies will
            often lose money for the first few years, it takes time to build
            valuable things, wait 10 to 15 years. The only plan to be considered
            is the 15yr plan. Money makes money, follow exponential growth,
            compounding is the key.
          </p>
          <p>Is now the right time to start this particular business?</p>

          <h3>The Market</h3>
          <p>
            Start small, really small, smaller than you think its small. Its way
            easier to reach a few thousands that really need a product than
            millions of "nice to have". Sequence and time new markets and
            scaling up a product. Dominate a niche and scale up from there,
            toward a long term vision. Competitive markets destroy profits. Can
            the idea become a monopoly withing its market? Entrepreneurs are
            always biased to understate the scale of competition, the fatal
            mistake of describing tour market so narrowly that you dominate by
            definition . Never lose sight of competitive reality. Trillion
            dollar markets mean ruthless, bloody competition. As you expand to
            adjacent markets avoid competition as much as possible. Will the
            market will be relevant in 15 years? Are the foundations relevant in
            25 years?
          </p>

          <h3>The Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            Network effects make a product better as more people use it, but it
            has to be good so that the first users find value. Start in small
            markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Economies of Scale: the cost of adding one user is close to zero.
            Adding users does not require adding features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Branding: Does it speak to its audience? Does it have the potential
            to be a monopoly brand? No technology company can be built by
            branding alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advertising matters, and its not transparent and not the same as
            enterprise marketing. It takes hard work to make sales look easy.
            None of us want to be reminded when we are being sold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think about distribution as a key part of product design. Sometimes
            the product itself is a kind of distribution (Calendly calendar,
            Dropbox links) Customer Lifetime Value and Customer Acquisition cost
            are the temperature of your distribution. Hard to measure early on.
            Essential for fundraising and scaling. The bigger the deal the
            longer the sales cycle, and the opposite. Good sales enterprise
            starts small. The mission is to create a replicable sales/growth
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you have a way to distribute the product? Can it be done within
            the nature of the product?
          </p>

          <h3>The Investors</h3>
          <p>
            A small handful of companies radically outperform others. One
            successful investment should equal the entire fund. If its not a 40x
            investment then perhaps its not worth it. Always focus on the
            substance of the business, not a diversified hedging strategy. If
            you think you are playing a lottery you will most likely loose.
            Problematic investments are a waste of time, resources and morale.
            If a company is going downward, leave it, don't go down with it. The
            most successful are obvious right away. Don't allow an investor to
            have an excuse to not fund you. Don't allow investors to make you
            fill like you own them, if you've actually put in the work. Don't
            ever feel bad for failing, investor took the risk of money, you took
            the risk of time. Once comes back the latter one does not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have clear ownership manuals of the company. Boards are amazing post
            seed round, the smaller the better, of 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            What secret do the founders have that could perhaps share with you?
          </p>

          <h3>Customer</h3>
          <p>
            Customers wont care about any particular technology unless it solves
            a problem in a superior way. The world is not a laboratory, selling
            and delivering the product to the customer is as important as the
            product itself.
          </p>

          <h3>Luck?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. Chance is underrated, planning is overrated. Discipline
            and consistency from the team will not trump luck, but it will help
            the chances.
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot change the world by planning, listening to advice or
            copying other peoples success. Treat the future as something defined
            by your product and advance to shape it.
          </p>
