          <p>
            Since the beginning of human civilization, our existence has been
            shaped by scarcity—of resources, time, and opportunity. Now, we
            stand in a profound transformation in human history. New
            technologies are fundamentally reshaping how we live, work and
            create value. Enter the era of superabundance.
          </p>

          <h3>Powering the Superabundance Economy</h3>

          <p>
            Energy becomes so cheap it basically is free, now let's consider
            what this would cause in our current economy.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Production costs plummet across
            industry, potentially enabling near zero marginal cost in what is
            becoming an almost fully robotic autonomous manufacturing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Logistics:</strong> transportation expenses would
            dramatically decrease, reshaping the global robotic autonomous
            supply chain.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Agriculture:</strong> food becomes almost free, as
            desalination and water purification become economical, labor goes
            close to zero as autonomous robots harvest.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Resource Extraction:</strong> Mining shifts from fossil
            fuels to renewable materials. Energy-intensive processing becomes
            viable. Autonomous robots extract continuously. Environmental
            remediation becomes standard practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Compute:</strong> Data centers operate at maximum capacity
            without energy constraints. AI processing becomes ubiquitous.
            Quantum computing accelerates breakthroughs. Global digital
            infrastructure expands to all regions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Education:</strong> Learning becomes personalized and
            lifelong. AI tutors adapt to individual needs. Virtual reality
            enables immersive experiences. Global knowledge access eliminates
            educational inequality.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Healthcare:</strong> Bioprinting creates organs on demand.
            AI diagnostics prevent disease. Medical robots perform precision
            surgeries. Personalized treatments become universally accessible.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Construction:</strong> 3D-printed buildings rise in days not
            months. Self-healing materials reduce maintenance. Carbon-negative
            structures absorb emissions. Adaptive architecture responds to
            environmental conditions.
          </p>

          <p>And finally…</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Creative Industries:</strong> AI collaboration tools amplify
            human creativity. Virtual production eliminates physical
            constraints. Creator economy flourishes with minimal barriers, the
            personal brand, and audience amplification becomes a form of value
            and wealth. Digital experiences become indistinguishable from
            reality, the simulation theory.
          </p>

          <h3>Human Activity in the Superabundance Economy</h3>

          <p>
            People will shift from a service-based economy to a meaning-based
            economy. Value creation resources include: human creativity,
            experience design and curation, relationship cultivation,
            purpose-driven ventures, ethics and culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike the service-based economy which monetizes on energy and
            performing tasks/labor, the new economy would value only uniquely
            human capabilities that a machine cannot replicate - particularly
            those involving wisdom, context, empathy and imagination.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concept of companies will change completely, and focus on human
            potential acceleration, helping humans discover purpose and develop
            skills. These organizations will excel when connecting people with
            purpose. As material scarcity diminishes, winning businesses will
            help people navigate questions of meaning, identity, and
            fulfillment.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we move into this era, our jobs will become very much so of
            supervision, approval and storytelling.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most crucial skills of the 21st century aren't technical but
            philosophical—critical thinking, empathy, and adaptability.
          </p>

          <p>
            All this has been said before, in one way or another, but I truly
            believe that this change is happening in the next 5 years. I'm
            personally excited to be designing the future with intention of
            being intelligent, autonomous and deeply human-centered.
