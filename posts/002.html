            In the labyrinth of the human experience, history stands as a light
            shinning the twists and turns of our past. It serves both as guide
            and a cautionary tale. History teaches us to manage our
            expectations, to understand where we have lost our way, and to guide
            us in navigating the rough seas of life — giving us a false fantasy
            of relief. History is not a reliable guide for making precise
            predictions of impactful events.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider the most pivotal moments in human history: the discovery of
            Penicillin (1928), the peace keeping Manhattan Project (1945), the
            markets Black Monday (1987), the sudden collaps in the Dot-com
            Bubble (2000), the rise of the iPhone(2007), CRISPR-Cas9 Gene
            editing and modification (2012) — these are the outliers, the
            record-breaking events that defy prediction. The are the black swans
            of history, impossible to predict.
          </p>

          <p>
            Realizing the future might not look anything like the past is a
            special kind of skill that is not generally looked highly upon by
            investors, inventors, founders, economist, you name it. The world is
            full of surprises. Things that moved the needle the most are things
            that history gives us little or no guide about. Unprecedented
            events, ones we cant be prepared to face. True for both scary events
            like war or recession, and great events like innovation and
            discovery. The further you look back, the less likely history
            applies to today.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the internal struggle of risk and reward, there exists a gap —
            room for error. The gap between what could happen in the future and
            what must happen for success to be achieved is where we find true
            resilience. Endurance, an elusive quality, it the catalyst for
            compounding over time. Yet, in the pursuit of greatness, it exists a
            healthy dose of paranoia — attention and avoidance of too large of a
            risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            For in the end, it is the unknown that truly moves the needle of
            human progress. It is the unprecedented events, the great leaps into
            the unknown, that shape the course of history. We stand on the
            uncertainty of tomorrow, let us take note of the lessons of history,
            but let us also embrace the uncertainty of the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            This notion is simultaneously scary and empowering. It proves the
            potential for anyone to create the disruption or innovation capable
            of reshaping the world. Proving, the most unexpected origins often
            harbor the greatest the chances…
