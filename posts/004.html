          <p>
            Staying open to ideas, embracing uniqueness, patience fuels the
            creativity's journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's start by noticing mundane and everyday acts, routines, and
            decisions. Although we don't choose when the idea will come, let's
            be open to possibilities and keep our minds open. Current proven
            solutions and products can sometimes be the least helpful;
            opportunities lie one degree away. Countless inventions were made by
            accident.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding what makes you feel alive, let's embrace our weirdness
            and build our own niche. Addressing our uniqueness, let's comprehend
            who we are by reconnecting with our childhood obsessions (e.g.,
            LEGO, art, building, technology, exercising). Ask your family.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creating something worthwhile will take a lot of time, and we have
            to train for it, like a marathon. Preparation will be key; it
            requires mastering forms in our field, years of practice. Impatience
            is our enemy and the greatest obstacle to our creativity. The best
            route is learning for its own sake.
          </p>

          <p>
            We want to create something quick and make an impact. But if not
            ready, customers will notice. The best route is learning for our own
            sake, starting with the customer experience and working backward.
            Asking ourselves:
          </p>

          <p>
            Where can we take the customer?<br />
            How do we make him feel?<br />
            What are we solving?<br />
            Why will he stay?
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to creative endeavors, time is always relative.
            Deadlines are extremely helpful but not necessary right now. Let's
            use our internal gut feeling and notice what really holds our
            interest. Working on multiple products and solutions at a time will
            prevent tunnel view. Always maintaining momentum and letting it
            compound, consistency and time will do the work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Failures are necessary learning to get where we are going. Each one
            gets you closer. Enjoy the process of iterating. Leverage the power
            of being a little imperfect. Activate your network and seek
            mentorship for the fundamentals. Pause for a moment and grease up
            gears of forgotten skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            Constantly remind ourselves of how little we truly know, and of how
            mysterious the world remains. Combine this with curiosity; always
            keep searching for answers and the pursuit of greatness. The work
            will reveal and make sense as we go.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's create a powerful underlying structure, something that will
            hold everything together. The idea will be ready when we feel it is.
            It will only get harder.
