          Understanding Innovation Through Historical Examples
        </h2>
        <time datetime="2024-02-21">February 21, 2024</time>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>
            Let's start by defining what innovation is: any act, idea, or
            product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms existing
            domain into a new one. It is important to remember, however, that a
            domain cannot be changed without the explicit or implicit consent of
            a field responsible for it.
          </p>

          <p>
            If innovation is more than personal insights and is cocreated by
            domains, fields, and persons, then creativity can be constructed,
            deconstructed, and reconstructed several times over the course of
            history.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most important implication of a system model is that the level
            of innovation in a given place and at a given time does not depend
            only on the amount of the individual. We are used to thinking that
            innovation begins and ends with a person, it is easy to miss the
            fact that the greatest spur to it may come from changes outside the
            individual.
          </p>

          <h3>Innovation in Collaboration - Florence 1400s</h3>

          <p>
            A good example is the sudden spurt in artistic creativity and
            innovation that took place in Florence between 1400. These were the
            golden years of the renaissance, and it is generally agreed that
            some of the most influential works of art in Europe were created
            during that quarter century.
          </p>

          <p>
            If innovation is something entirely within a person, we would have
            to argue that for some reason an unusually large number of creative
            artists were born in Florence in the last decades of the fourteenth
            century. Perhaps some freak genetic mutation occurred, or a drastic
            change in the education of Florentine children suddenly caused them
            to become more creative. But an explanation involving the domain and
            the field is much more sensible.
          </p>

          <p>
            No other place matched Florence in the intensity and depth of
            artistic achievement. Why is that so?
          </p>

          <p>
            The explanation is that the field of art became particularly
            favorable to the creation of new works at just about the same time
            as the rediscovery of the ancient domains of art. Florence had
            become one of the richest cities in Europe first through trading,
            then through the manufacture of wool and other textiles, and finally
            through the financial expertise of its rich merchants.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was an atmosphere of wealth and uncertainty that the urban
            leaders decided to invest in making Florence the most beautiful
            city, by commissioning great frescoes and majestic statues, they
            must have felt that they were weaving a protective spell around
            their homes and businesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            The important thing to realize is that when the Florentine bankers,
            churchmen, and heads of great guilds decided to take their city
            intimidatingly beautiful, they did not just throw money at artists
            and wait to see what happened. They became intensely involved, in
            the process encouraging, evaluating, and selecting the works they
            wanted to see completed. It was because leading citizens, as well as
            the common people, were so seriously concerned with the outcome of
            heir work that the artists were pushed to perform beyond the
            previous limits.
          </p>

          <h3>Innovation in Isolation - US 1940s</h3>

          <p>
            In 1941, John Mauchly made a pivotal four-day visit to John Vincent
            Atanasoff's laboratory in Iowa State College. Atanasoff had been
            working in relative isolation on an electric computing machine since
            1937. During these four days, Mauchly examined Atanasoff partially
            completed computer, the ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer), discussed
            technical details, and reviewed Atanasoff extensive documentation.
            The visit would later become the center of a historic patent
            dispute, as elements of Atanasoff design appeared in ENIAC, the
            computer Mauchly claimed his ENIAC design was independently
            conceived, his exposure to Atanasoff ideas during those four days in
            Iowa proved crucial to the development of electronic computing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Atanasoff's story demonstrates how isolation can limit innovation.
            While he conceived an electronic computer in Iowa, his physical and
            intellectual isolation severely constrained his ability to fully
            develop the idea. In contrast, when Mauchly visited Atanasoff in
            1941, he was already part of a vibrant scientific community at the
            University of Pennsylvania. After seeing Atanasoff's work, Mauchly
            could build upon those ideas within a rich ecosystem of engineers,
            technicians, and mathematicians - particularly collaborating with
            Presper Eckert. Had Atanasoff been working within such a community
            rather than alone in Iowa, he may have overcome the technical
            challenges that left his computer only partially complete. His story
            reinforces that groundbreaking innovation rarely emerges from
            solitary genius, but rather from the collision and refinement of
            ideas within supportive networks.
          </p>

          <h3>The AI Revolution - San Francisco Now</h3>

          <p>
            Currently something special is happening in San Francisco. I believe
            building a company in the office 5+ days / week in SF gives you the
            highest probability of building a generational tech company. The
            talent density is second to none and it's where your first customers
            most likely be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Innovation is usually a group effort, involving collaboration
            between visionaries and engineers, and that creativity comes from
            drawing from many sources. Only in storybooks do inventions come
            like a thunderbolt, or a lightbulb popping out of the head of a lone
            individual in a basement or garage.
          </p>

          <p>
            These historical examples and my current experience in San Francisco
            reassure me that it's the best place for me, the company, the team,
            and innovation appetite. While individual brilliance matters, it's
            the ecosystem — the combination of skilled people, supportive
            institutions, and cultural dynamics — that transforms ideas into
            revolutionary changes.
